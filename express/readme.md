## Lint the code with ESLint

`eslint` needs to be installed locally:

```bash
npm install -g eslint@latest
```

Most likely this is the only
[extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
needed in VSCode to automagically lint.

## Format the code with Prettier

A prettier configuration file has also been added. Install it for VSCode
[here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).
